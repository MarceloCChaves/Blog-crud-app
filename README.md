# Codeleap Test

## 🎯 Objectives
Frontend assessment criteria

### Key points
You will be assessed according to several different points:
- In general, you should develop this as if it’s targeted for an end consumer, not for other developers. Try to impress the user within the design limitations, not just the developers.
- Your project should look exactly like these designs here, and you will not be assessed for making the designs radically customised. You can try to surprise us, but do so at your own risk!
- Consistency is key so make sure everything looks nice, neat, symmetrical and spaced correctly.
- Usability is paramount. Make sure a regular person would be able to understand and use the interface easily in different scenarios, starting points, devices or screen sizes.
- Attention to details. Please make sure you carefully look at all details in this page.
- Keep it simple. On your code, you will be assessed by how effectively you can achieve this task and reutilise your own code. We’re looking for people with are objective and results oriented.
- Deliver quickly. Although this is not the only criteria, we will judge your results based on how quickly you deliver this test once started.

### Bonus points
Essentially, you will gain bonus points for making the user experience better. Here are a few examples, but you can be more creative if you’d like.
- Make it responsive on mobile devices.
- Implement some kind of permanent login logout solution.
- Implement pagination or infinite scroll using the provided endpoints.
- Pretty animations, transitions or hover effects. 
- Any other ideas? Surprise us :)
